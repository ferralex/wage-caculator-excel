# Wage Caculator in Excel

I’ve been a language instructor for a few years and have worked for different companies.

Each of them has a different system to calculate their staff wages. They could be confusing and prone to mistakes if you don’t track your worked hours correctly.

To improve my Excel skills, I decided to make a spreadsheet to help calculate the monthly wages.

In order to obtain this result, other than functions like **=SUM()** and **INDEX()**, I used **macros**, **data validation**, and **named ranges**.
